## ScreenSHX    

### What is this? 
ScreenSHX is a screensharing software. ScreenSHX is to be a commerically aimed, but opensource version of [Vivi](https://vivi.io): [Github](https://github.com/Viviedu). Please do check out Vivi in the mean time if you think that Vivi is right for your education network.
This project will be here to help people be able to share their screen with a Class, or with Board members over LAN, without a subscription or payment model.

The project is highly underworks. What you will notice with our repos, is we will be forking projects, and modifiying it to be to linking for our project.
