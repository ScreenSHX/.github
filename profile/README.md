## ScreenSHX    

### What is this? 
This is a screensharing software. This is going to be a more non-education aimed version of [Vivi](https://vivi.io): [Github](https://github.com/Viviedu). Please do check out Vivi in the mean time if you think that Vivi is right for your education network.
This project will be here to help let more Companies use our software to share their device, over a LAN (Local Area Network). 
This is a project that is managed by [InvraNet](https://github.com/InvraNet). 

The project is highly underworks. What you will notice with our repos, is we will be forking projects, and modifiying it to be to linking for our project.
